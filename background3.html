    <p>External style sheets are by far the most powerful way to use CSS because you
can make style changes across an entire site simply by editing a single style
sheet document. That is the advantage to having all the style information in
one place, and not mixed in with the document source.
Furthermore, because a single style document is downloaded and cached
by the browser for the whole site, there is less code to download with every
document, resulting in better performance.
First, a little bit about the style sheet document itself. An external style sheet
is a plain-text document with at least one style sheet rule. It may not include
any HTML tags (thereâ€™s no reason to include them, anyway).</p></div>
