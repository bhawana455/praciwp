    <div id="container1"><p>Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice)[1] is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as<br> a snack or dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice, such as cocoa or vanilla.<br>Colourings are usually added, in addition to stabilizers.<br>The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.<br>The result is a smooth, 
        semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). <br>It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</p> </div>
