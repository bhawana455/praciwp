    <p><img src="download (1).jfif" alt="browser">At this point, you’ve learned dozens of CSS properties that let you change
the appearance of text elements and the boxes they generate.<br> But so far, we’ve
merely been formatting elements as they appear in the flow of the document.<br>
In this chapter, we’ll look at floating and positioning, the CSS methods
for breaking out of the normal flow and arranging elements on the page.<br>
Floating an element moves it to the left or right and allows the following text
to wrap around it. Positioning is a way to specify the location of an element
anywhere on the page with pixel precision.<br>
Before we start moving elements around, let’s be sure we are well acquainted
with how they behave in the normal flow.First,<br> you’ll notice that the style rule that floats the span includes the
width property. It is necessary to specify a width for a floated text element
because without one, its box is sized wide enough to fit its content (auto).<br>
For short phrases that are narrower than the container, that might not be
an issue. However, for longer, wrapped text, the box expands to the width
of the container, making it so wide that there wouldn’t be room to wrap
anything around it. <br>Images have an inherent width, so we didn’t need to
specify a width in the previous example (although we certainly could have)
