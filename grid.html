             <p>When the browser goes about sizing a flex item, it consults the flex-basis
                value, compares it to the available space along the axis, and then adds or
                removes space from items according to their grow and shrink settings. Itâ€™s
                important to note that if you allow an item to grow or shrink, it could end
                up being narrower or wider than the length provided by flex-basis or width.</p>

          <ul><p>The advantage to using the flex property is that there are some handy
            shortcut values that cover typical Flexbox scenarios. Curiously, some of the
            shortcut values override the defaults of the individual properties, which was
            confusing to me at first, but in the end it results in more predictable behaviors.In this example, the flex basis for the boxes is set to 100 pixels because the
            auto value uses the value set by width</p></ul>
